# FCI Standup

For maximum learning and effective problem-solving, we need regular communication across campuses and between campuses and FCI. FCI should also provide targeted support to individual facilitators to help them maximize personal growth and to support problem-solving and reflection.

### Weekly 30 minute standup: FCI + all course facilitators:

- What went well this week? 
- What needs improvement for next week?
- Is there anything that concerns you?

_Note:_ for current facilitators, attendance is mandatory, incoming facilitators must attend the week before they take over, and past/future faciliators are welcome to join on a voluntary basis
 
### Weekly 30 minute mentorship meetings: @sofer + @rebeccaradding + individual facilitators:

- To support development as course facilitators and on selected external projects
