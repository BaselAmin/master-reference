# FCI Standup

**Present:** Yvonne, Shireen, Zooey, Aisha

### Gaza
- Good local mentors this week, CF has done very little in the classroom
- In research, the code is copied from the internet (consistent problems with research afternoon each week)
- Suggestions to make research time shorter, and presentation longer to have an open conversation
- One particular team with communication problems, along with gender divide amongst teams is still a problem
- CF and local CF are both making good efforts in mediating with team dynamics
- CF role feels like people management not curriculum delivery (cross-campus agreement)

### London
- Code review is also not prioritized 
- Students are trying to make a student-project portfolio website for their Week 13-16
- CF wants to move away from the teacher-student dynamic
- Will give reminder of the importance of peer-led learning

### Nazareth
- Resonates with almost everything happening in Gaza  
- Difficult week for some, people misunderstood(ignored) instruction for project

### Action Point
- Cross-camps will set up a call to discuss curriculum planning after reading week, set up mentor expectations early
