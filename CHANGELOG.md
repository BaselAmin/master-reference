# Changelog

This document will serve as a place for master-reference maintainers and CFs to log changes to workshops used in the master-reference. Since workshops live in separate repos it's otherwise hard to keep track of what has changed.

Please add changes to the top, and include the date, a link to the PR where the changes occured, the week that workshop is currently scheduled in, and a list summarising the changes.
