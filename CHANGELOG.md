# Changelog

This document will serve as a place for master-reference maintainers and CFs to log changes to workshops used in the master-reference. Since workshops live in separate repos it's otherwise to keep track of what has changed.

Please add the change to the top of the log so that the most recent changes are at the top of the document and include the date, a link to the repository in question, and a bulleted description of the change.
