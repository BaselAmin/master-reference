We'd like you to build an image carousel. Please write all the code yourself (so no libraries like jQuery or Bootstrap). The image carousel must be built into your personal website.

### Features

1. Responsive (works on mobile and desktop)
2. Display one image at a time
3. Move between images when clicking navigation buttons
4. Toggle automatically looping through all images with a play/pause button
5. Allow keyboard navigation between images with the left/right arrow keys


### Learning outcomes

- Document Object Model (DOM)
- Accessing and manipulating the DOM with JavaScript
- Adding event listeners to react to user input

You're more than welcome to be creative with your project as long as you meet the minimum features and the learning outcomes.
