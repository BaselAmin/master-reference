## Today I Learned (TIL)

Popularised by sites like Reddit and Digg:
> Today I Learned, often shortened as TIL, is an online expression typically used in the title of a post or discussion thread when introducing an interesting fact or trivia that had been previously unknown to the poster, in a similar vein to the phrase “did you know?”

This can be presented as a very short "lightning talk" (10 minutes or less) from your group to the rest of your cohort. So think about what your group has learned that the rest of the cohort would benefit from hearing about.

You can think of this in the same way as the section of your [presentations during weeks 1-8](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/general/weekly-projects.md#project-presentation) where you discuss "something you're proud of" and/or "something that you found really hard / struggled with".

Your TIL can be on any topic that has been relevant to your team.

It could be something broad:
+ implementation of Agile roles
+ division of tasks
+ workflow
+ pivotting from one idea to another
+ how to conduct a spike effectively (e.g. on a new technology)

or you may want to "deep dive" into a specific piece of code, in order to demonstrate:
+ a new piece of tech
+ deeper understanding & consolidation of a topic from weeks 1-8
