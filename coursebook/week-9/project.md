# Project

You need to build an Express server/Api that is connected to a Postgres database, through this Api we would want to manipulate some data (either add remove or update).

When you feel like the server is done and ready to be used.
Build a frontend app using React that would use the Api you have built with Express. 

**Note: building this frontend app is not the main objective it is considered a strech goal, the main objective is to learn how to build an Express server**.

Feel free to connect your server with last week's project. or build a frontend from scratch, your choice :man-shrugging: 

## Tip

When you do get to the part where you want to build a frontend app for with your Api, make sure to open a different repository on github just for your frontend or for you React project.

We do that because we don't want to have 2 projects in 1 repository (or better explained as we don't have more than 1 `package.json` in 1 repository) and start to get lost in the giant folder structure.

## Goals

- Build an Express server (using an Express generator in not allowed)
- Connect your server to Postgres database
- Create routes to manipulate data
- Deploy your server on Heroku
- Test your server

## Stretch goals

- Connect your server with a React frontend
