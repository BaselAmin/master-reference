# Project

Continue last week's project, feel free to add any feature that you like!

Here are some ideas if you don't have any:

- Create a server and a database and connect them to your React app.
- Add more pages related to your app.
- Use an external API.

> Quick tip: in case you actually want to build a server for you frontend, make sure you create it in a new repository.

Make sure to explore packages from React and Express and practice subjects that you are not fully confident with.
