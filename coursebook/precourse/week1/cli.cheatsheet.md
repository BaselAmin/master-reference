# Command line interface - Cheat sheet

> [From CLI workshop](https://github.com/WebAhead/cli-intro)

- The Command Line Interface does that too, but it allows you to do it with more precision and power. You type words and hit enter, the shell interprets those words, and works with the OS and files to execute the command.

- It is much faster since there are no graphics involved.

---

- pwd - print working directory
> prints the current directory you are in.

---

- ls - list
> prints the contents of the current directory.

---


- cd - change directory (change folder)
> changes the current directory to the target directory

---


- clear
> clears the terminal's previous outputs

---


- mkdir - make directory
> creates a new directory in the current directory.

---


-  touch
> creates a new file in the current directory.

---


- code some-file
> opens the target file with visual studio code.

---


- cat - concatenate
> prints the file's content onto the terminal.

---


- cd .
> the . is the a reference for the current directory, so when you do cd . what you essentially told the computer to do is change directory to the current directory.

---


- cd ..
> change to the parent directory of the current directory or go back a directory.

---


- cd ~
> change directory to the computer's home directory.

---


- code .
> will open the current directory with visual studio code.

---


- history
> lists the commands you used 

---


- cat file | grep -i apple
> Search for the word 'apple' in the file

---

- pipe |
> pipes the commands's output onto the next command

---

- sudo
> Some commands need permissions to run
