# React project

Build either a social media or an e-commerce react app or even a game!, you can choose the theme and the topic of the app.
You are going to continue working on this project next week, so think of someting that is going to be scalable. if you are having triuble thinking of an idea ask a mentor!

## Criteria

- Accept some user input
- Populate the UI with fake data
- Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.
  - A cart where you save the selected items
  - What posts did you like today

### Stretch criteria

- Make it look sick
- Query a third party API (e.g. the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), or any other [fun one](https://www.potterapi.com/))

## Setup

We're using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to handle all our bundling, linting etc.

1. `npx create-react-app [my-app-name]` generate the project (might take a while)
1. `cd [my-app-name]`
1. `npm start` start the dev server

Open the project in your editorâ€”you should see an example app setup. Feel free to delete the logo/CSS/service worker that you won't be using.

### Linting

Create React App includes a comprehensive ESLint config. You will see linting errors displayed in your terminal or browser console. If you have an ESLint editor plugin installed you should also see errors highlighted as you write.


### Deployment

We'll be deploying our apps to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com and login with Github
1. Click the "New site from Git" button
1. Choose "Github" as your provider (and authorize it)
1. Choose the repo you want to deploy
1. Choose "Deploy site" (the build settings for CRA should be pre-filled)

Now every time you push to the Master branch your site will redeploy.

### API secrets

If you have API tokens you want to prevent reaching Github you should use Create React App's [environment variable support](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).

1. Create a gitignored `.env` at the root of your project
1. Add your environment variables, prefacing them with `REACT_APP_`. e.g.
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN=123456
   ```
1. Access the token in your code as `process.env.REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN`

You will need to configure Netlify to inject this value when it deploys your site too (just like Heroku). You can do this under "Site settings" > "Build & deploy" > "Environment" > "Environment variables".

#### IMPORTANT!

Since all your code is client-side it will all be available in the browser. This means if someone looked inside your JS using dev tools they would be able to find this token. If you have an API key that absolutely _must_ stay secret you need to make your requests on a server instead. You may find [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) useful for adding simple Node endpoints to a mostly-frontend app (but they're probably not necessary for this project).
