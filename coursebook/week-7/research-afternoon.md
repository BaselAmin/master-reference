## Research afternoon

### Schemas and relationships
  - What is a schema and why/when would you need one?
  - What are primary keys and why do we need them?
  - Create a visual representation of a mock schema for a database about Founders & Coders, using as many different kinds of relationship as you can. Explain the logic behind it.

### Database setup and maintenance
  - What is a build script and why do you need one? (think ahead to how this might come in useful when working on a project this week)
  - What is the difference between a development, testing and production database ?
    - Give a demo on how to create a production database on Heroku.
  - Create a build script for a simple database (one or two tables only), which you can run locally. Check that it works for you and everyone on your team

### Script injections / safety issues
  - What is a script injection and how do these happen?
  - How would you prevent script injections?
  - Prepare a short demonstration of good (and bad?) practices, including some sample code

### SQL vs NoSQL databases
  - The differences between SQL and NoSQL databases
  - Pros and cons of SQL and NoSQL databases
  - Examples of the data structure of SQL and NoSQL databases
  - Examples of queries for SQL and NoSQL databases
