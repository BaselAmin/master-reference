## FCI Standup
October 24, 2017

**Present:** Dan, Rebecca, Shireen, Aisha

#### London reports on day 1:
- Projects are being introduced before research
- Dan delivered welcome talk and part of course overview (with Cleo)
- In the afternoon, Aisha had students review the intro-to-cooperation, then Aisha and Eoin introduced consensus by discussing tea and coffee purchasing
- Shireen: please update week 1 schedule in the `master-reference`

#### Business development:
- Dan briefly discussed the topic during the course overview
- Plan is to introduce the format next Monday 
- London feels the task groups were a mixed bag, but some but not many successful outcomes - not a great use of people's time
- Refocusing all energies on what makes a good project and reaching out to potential clients during that time
- Environment task group was relatively successful, Dan suggests people make those suggestions in SGC and action them on Fridays when they come up
- Shireen reports that environment issues will also be brought up during SGCs in Nazareth
- Dan's recommendation for Nazareth: start thinking about first round of project ideas, reaching out to community organisations to discuss project ideas
- Shireen's concern: Nazareth applicant pool
- Rebecca: interns/volunteers would probably be better placed to organise these efforts

#### Prepararing for FACN3 and FACG3
- Dan will share a slidedeck with a welcome talk and course overview
- Rebecca will revise community talk (to include discussion of self-organising learning environment) and send to Shireen for her discussion with mentors on Wednesday
