## FCI Standup

**Present:** Shireen, Zooey, Rebecca, Dan, Aisha

### London
- Students enjoyed the week 1 project
- Changes to week 2 have been positive so far
- Minor schedule change (noted in `master-reference`)
- Students have self-assigned to pastoral care team members
- Business developed introduced on day 1 of week 2, started by explaining history, alumni then explained what they did for their longer projects, students were tasked with starting to think about what they might want to do during the second half of the course

### Nazareth
- Shireen is encouraging students to raise issues on workshops in the `master-reference`
- Some students are working alone instead of in pairs
- Vered added an intro to research and intro to pair programming to the workshops, these worked well
- Shireen explained Nazareth mentoring structure with graduate interns and visiting mentors

### Gaza
- Zooey is unsure what business development will/should look like in Gaza
- Dan thinks students should be working on engaging with potential NGO clients
- Goal is for local mentors to do as much leading as possible, main concern is around how this might affect level of English, given goal of preparing students to work with international companies?
