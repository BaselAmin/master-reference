# FCI Standup

**Present:** Yvonne, Shireen, Zooey, Ghada, Rebecca

### Nazareth
- Callbacks remain a significant challenge (morning challenge possibly caused more confusion)
- Students don't seem to understand what "asynchronous" means
- Changed research for this week - formatted as a discussion - results weren't much better, as less outgoing people didn't participate
- Week 4 project - really difficult, students feel overwhelmed
- Reminder to refocus on communicating how hard the course will be, so students enter with strong prerequisites, and expect things to be overwhelming, expect struggle
- Weeks 13-16 - a potential client is visiting soon

### Gaza
- Similar challenges related to callbacks and asychronicity 
- Team changes have been smooth
- Some issues with people using code and not understanding what it does
- Some issues with pushing code during code review
- Some students are still prioritising finished product over process
- Focus on helping the mentors prepare for their weeks
- English/Arabic balance remains something to navigate - a miscommunication happened this week due to material delivered in Arabic (so Zooey couldn't catch the mistake)
- Value of employers talking about why hiring FAC graduates is valuable
