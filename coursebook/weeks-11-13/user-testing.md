# User Testing Guide 

For groups of four, influenced by [Rocket Surgery Made Easy](http://www.sensible.com/rsme.html) and [Usability Cafe](https://youtu.be/0YL0xoSmyZI)

## 1. Planning

You'll need to decide on;

1. **Tasks** - 1-3 app-exploration tasks that you would like a test participant to do.
2. **User Profile** - The kinds of potential users you should test with (don't obsess over this, most users can offer helpful usability insights!).
3. **Test Equipment** - A suitable *test* device (phone/computer) and *observing* device (phone/computer). The *test* device should share it's *screen* & microphone audio with the *observing* device (consider a Google Hangouts call).
3. **Date** - With 3 hour time slot.
4. **Recruit/Approach** - Whether to recruit specific users beforehand or approach random members of the public on test day.
6. **Compensation** - A free coffee maybe? Or just a warm thanks!
5. **Venue**- Check that it has *wifi*, a space available to conduct a session and a seperate space for other team members to observe a session, 
    - If *recruiting users*- send out an invitation beforehand, explain purpose, time & date and compensation. When a participant accepts, assign them a *20 minute* window within the 3 hour time slot and let them know. 
    - If *approaching public*- contact venue beforehand for permission. 


## 2. Build Script/Guide

1. **Introduction** - *Thank for helping us today. Just so you know, some of my team will be observing the session today from a seperate location, they're viewing the screen on our testing device and can hear your voice, so won't be a distraction. My name is ___, I’m a developer on the application, the application we're working on is a ________.*
2. **Explanation** - *I’d like to show you the application first.* (show them home page) *I’m going to give you a few tasks to do from the our home page. It's a very free exercise so there are no right or wrong ways of doing things, this is not about you getting something wrong or right, we're looking to learn about the application. So that we know how you're finding it, we want you to talk aloud whatever you're thinking. So as you explore it, tell us anything that comes into your mind.*
3. **Task 1** - *The first task I’d like you to do is __________, whenever your ready please begin.*
4. **Task 2** - *Thank you, thank next task I'd like you to do is __________.* (repeat for remaining tasks).
5. **Afterwards** - *How did you find using the application? Did anything stick out for you that you’d like to share?*
6. **Wrap Up** - *May I ask you a few additional questions about yourself?* 
   - *What is your occupation?* 
   - *Do you use apps often?*
   - *Have you used similar apps before?*
   - *Do you have any questions for me?*
7. **Thanks** - *The session is now complete, I’d like to thank you for the help you’ve given us to improve our application.* 


## 3. Test Day (Pre-Test)

1. Assign a facilitator from group to conduct tests (other team members should observe). Feel free to swap role of facilitator between tests.
2. Prepare testing & observing equipment at venue (ensure both are seperate enough from each other- the participants voice audio shouldn't be heard by the participant!).
3. Create an issue in your groups repo:  **User Testing: (DD-MM-YYYY)**
4. At the top of the issue, create an *obververs template*, and add it to the top of the issue. This will be pasted into a comment during a testing session and filled in by the observer. The Template should include fields for:  
   - Users name.
   - Users top three pain points using application.
   - Users profile.  
   - Additional observations section.
5. (If **approaching public**); 
   - Facilitator should use a **Permission** statement when approaching public; *Hi, do you have time to help us today test an application we’re working on for a free ____? It’ll take about 20 minutes of your time.*
   - Consider sitting in an area with public traffic, set up a small paper sign that says 'Help us test our application today for a free _____! Time - 20 minutes'.

## 4. Test Session (x 3)

### Facilitator 

- When participant is ready, sit them down next to test equipment, ask them if they're comfortable, then check test equipment is working and broadcasting to observing equipment successfully.
- Remember to keep track of time, it should be;
    - 5 minutes setting up & introduction.
    - 10 minutes for tasks.
    - 5 minutes for questions and wrap up.
- **During Tasks**;
    - Try not to speak unless asked something by participant (let them speak).
    - If the participant;
        - asks you how to do something; _How do you think you should do it?_.
        - stops speaking for a while; _Please remember to speak your thoughts aloud_.
        - makes a comment & you're not sure what triggered it; _Was there something in particular that made you think that?_.
        - wanders away from the task; _What are you trying to do now?_.
 - **After Test**;
    - Ask **Wrap Up** questions and **Thank** participant for their time.
    - Give them their compensation.
    - Check observing team have recorded their observations.
    - Prepare next test (or **Debrief** with team).
    
### Observers - 
- Create a new comment in your **User Testing** issue from Template.
- Ensure test equipment stream is seen & heard on observing equipment.
- (Optional) Record live stream, to reference later with.
- **During Tasks**;
    - Remain quiet (but write down notes on pen & paper/your own notes app).
    - Don't disturb other observers.
- **After Test**;
    - Discuss observations, then fill in Template in comment.


## 5. Debrief

- Explore common user feedback and agree on most prominent issues (2-3) to address first, then discuss how to address issues.
