## Preparing for your build sprint
1. Break down your user journey into user stories
1. Re-draw your wireframes (depending on whether the results of your user testing has changed your ideas from the prototype)
1. Talk through your [choice of tech stack](./tech-choices.md) with the help of your mentors.
1. You may choose to run through the architectural flow of your app at this point.

## [Sprint planning](https://github.com/dwyl/process-handbook#sprint-planning)

With your Product Owner and Scrum Master, write out your tasks to be done in issues.

Start with an issue per user story & break these into sub-issues as/when necessary.

Each issue should contain:
- pictures of your wireframes
- acceptance criteria (define these with your PO)
- a priority label ([import DWYL labels](https://label-sync.herokuapp.com/login))
- a time estimate

Then
- order the issues in your milestone accordingly
- assign issues

Note: you may want to factor in technical spikes to your build time estimates, depending on your choice of tech stack.

## Starting work
1. Write your initial `README.md`  
Remember: You will have a time slot ("Today I Learned" in the 2nd week) for a quick show and tell. If you update your documentation as you go, you can use this to showcase what you have learned to the rest of your cohort.

1. Set up your environment
    - Deployment (e.g. Heroku)
    - Continuous Integration (e.g. Travis)
    - Linter
    - File structure
