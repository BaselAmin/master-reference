Give your last week's project an upgrade with Express!

The main goal of this week's project is to practice using Express, and extend 


### Goals:

1) Use Express for your backend.

2) Add Basic authentication (login with cookies)

3) Host your project on Heroku.


4) Include Error Handling. For example:
  - if a user attempts to make a request to a non-existent route to your server (404 - as mentioned above), provide the user with a custom response.    
  - if there is a [programmer error](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/error-handling-workshop#kinds-of-errors) on your server (e.g. a handler function does not act as intended), provide the user with a custom response (500 status code).
