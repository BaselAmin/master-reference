# Project

upgrade to Express!

The main goal of this week's project is to practice using Express, and extend last week's project functionality by adding some basic authentication (using cookies and middlewares) and more routes.

### Goals:

1) Use Express for your backend.
2) Add Basic authentication
3) Use Express middlewares
4) Host your project on Heroku.
5) Include Error Handling. For example:
  - if a user attempts to make a request to a non-existent route to your server (404 - as mentioned above), provide the user with a custom response.    
  - if there is a [programmer error](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/error-handling-workshop#kinds-of-errors) on your server (e.g. a handler function does not act as intended), provide the user with a custom response (500 status code).
