# Mentorship techniques

See [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aYncaSB8ffVnccyBIisftG0FaBZK-RUHe2UM5AC4m-o/edit?usp=sharing).

Mentorship is about building relationships and empowering students' confidence in their own abilities.

1. Always ask questions first. Most of the time the students actually know the answer, but just don’t feel confident in it.
  + Have you asked the other members of your team?
  + Have you asked other students outside of your team? [If you know a team that has worked through the same problem, point them to that team]
  + What did you google for?
2. Respond positively to questions. Asking questions is scary, so help people to feel comfortable and try to encourage that behaviour.
3. The student should always be in control of the keyboard and mouse (don’t type for them). Very occassionally, you might need to write something (e.g. pseudo code). Avoid temptation by using a notepad.
4. Draw things out! Keep a notepad and pen with you and prepare yourself to draw out the problems/solutions to visually aid your explanations.
5. If you don’t know the answer that is completely okay! The best thing to do is find out the answer with the student. Google it and then you guys can both learn something new. Ideally this also signals to the person you are mentoring that it is okay not to know something.
6. Help break big problems down into small ones, especially if a student seems like they're feeling overwhelmed. They need to be shown they can figure it out on their own, you are just there to guide them. Write down the steps & encourage them just to focus on one step at a time.
7. Let them stumble. We learn by making mistakes, getting frustrated, and working through problem in our own way. Be supportive, but let them explore.
8. Don't say no when the students are not doing something right. Be gentle, approach it in a mild way. You can try asking them to explain the steps that they're taking. If you give them the answer, you're taking away an opportunity for them to learn.
9. Work collaboratively with your students. If you have two or more students, you should work with all of them. Don't focus all your attention on one of them. Encourage those who have figured it out first to then show this to the others.
10. Assume that anyone you're teaching has no knowledge but infinite intelligence.

Note: Students may be frustrated with you, especially at the beginning of the course, because they expect teachers to provide answers.


### Before the course we suggest you...

* Run through some of the material with someone who hasn’t coded before - This is deployed to Read the docs for easy viewing
* Get more practise! We recommend mentoring at [codebar](https://codebar.io/member/new). Many of the attendees there are new to programming so it is good preparation for the course.


## Other helpful tips
From feedback forms as well as group discussions about what makes a good mentor.

### Things to try and do
- Speak loudly enough to be heard at the back of the class when presenting
- Have fun when you can! It is obvious and infectious when someone is passionate about topic, or having fun with the content and/or delivery.
- Being aware of the learning outcomes for each week/workshop, and communicating them to the class
- Be assertive with timing!

### Things to avoid
- Offhandedly overusing phrases like "You will learn this later", or "This will be useless once you learn x".
   - While technically true, sometimes these kinds of phrases can be frustrating for students when given without further context. One way to alleviate this is to provide more explanation - e.g. "We will be learning how to do x in more detail later, but for now I suggest that we focus on y, which is more relevant for the current topic"
- Similarly, try to avoid overusing words like "simply", "easy", "just", and "basically" when you explain tasks or code. 
   - While 'easy' to use without thinking, this kind of phrasing can frustrate students who are learning and find the task hard, and don't actually contribute to your explanations.
- asking "Why are you doing x?" instead of more tone-aware phrasing like "Could you explain why you chose to use x here?"
   - Sometimes asking "why" has felt dismissive to students, and requires that we are more aware of our tone when asking clarifying questions.
- Rushing through code-alongs
   - Code-alongs are hard, particular to deliver effectively as a mentor. Take your time and work with your partner to be sure that everyone is on the same page and not getting left behind. It can make a big difference in someone's experience of a workshop.
- Being loud or distracting at the front of the class when you are bored
   - Sometimes certain exercises or days can be boring when everyone is working hard, and it is easy to get distracted, talk loudly, or leave the room for extended periods. Part of mentoring is being available and approachable, and this can be distracting for the students or make it harder for them to come to you with questions.
