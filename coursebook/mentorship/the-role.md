## Basics
- Be around full-time for your week
- Sign up to be a code reviewer during another week (as well as the week you are responsible for delivering)
- Turn up on time. Be ready to start at 10am and be there at least 15 mins early.
- Introduce the day's timetable at the start of the day and write up on whiteboard. It helps to have a visible display, as well as the online written schedule.
- Stick to the schedule as much as possible. But sometimes it's necessary to change things on the fly. Use your best judgment.
- If you do need to change the schedule, think about how to ensure that the learning outcomes of the week are still fulfilled.
- Your week does not exist in a vacuum. Think about the ongoing effect your decisions will have on future weeks.
- Remind them to pair programme
- Encourage students to raise issues
- Try to be around at least a little before your week (sorry week 1!) so you can get to know the students a bit in advance
- Share S-G-C notes with upcoming week leaders to keep them in the loop.

## Morning challenges and workshops
- Tell people where the repo/link is, and get them to find it through the Master Reference, it’s good practice for navigating github.
- Introduce students to the WS/MC, preferably on the projector.
- For workshops, if there is a pre-existing codebase, make sure you walk through the existing file structure together.
- In morning challenges avoid giving significant assistance. It’s 40 minutes to struggle, that’s not too long.
- Pay attention to the room, you’ll find out a lot about how things are going by eavesdropping.
- Float and check in halfway, to ensure that students are progressing. You don't want to wait until solution casting to find out they couldn't get past step 1.
- Leave enough time for solutions. If you ask students “Do you want more time?” they will pretty much always say yes, so be sensible with timings.
- Lollipop for answers and solutions. It's good practice for people to talk through their code, it encourages equal participation and it avoids the situation where everyone is too shy to volunteer.
- Don’t put the stick back in after drawing someone.

### Code-alongs
For the person leading the code along:
- Make sure you know the material inside out
- Run through it on your own in advance, so you don't need to read from a script. Preparation is key.
- If you need prompts, have a list of actions to remind you what to do.
- Don’t go too fast
- Try to not have an unusual text editor setup. That way, students are free to focus on the code you are writing.
- Make sure students are using the same variable names - made it way harder to troubleshoot errors. Encourage people to write what you're writing.

For the person floating:
- Know the material inside out
- Most of the problems people have will be typos
- Try to get good at scanning code for inconsistencies
- During the code along, if there’s a problem, this is one of the few times it’s ok to just straight up tell the student what to do. If they need/want to understand more in depth, it can wait until after the code along.

## Research afternoons
- Introduce students to the topics, preferably on the projector
- Remind students to prepare questions to ask the rest of their cohort. In earlier weeks, you may need to remind them to ask their questions at the end of their presentations.
- This is largely self-directed time, but mentors may float occasionally in order to spot any severe problems that are likely to leave the students with nothing to present & then help to unblock (e.g. googling together).

## Code reviews
- Use the cohort's sign up sheet to assign 1 reviewer per project - the 2 mentors of that week + 2 mentors from other weeks.  
Note: Students should post the links to their repos _before_ 10am (but they can easily be found within the cohort's github organisation).
- During "responding to issues" time, mentors can discuss what they've seen on projects. Are students making similar mistakes? Are they making mistakes across multiple weeks? Should these be highlighted to students during presentations or communicated to mentors of the next week?

## Presentation planning
- Prompt students to cover all bullet points in the presentation guidelines (most relevant in earlier weeks as students are getting used to the process)

## Presentations (research and projects)
Research & projects:
- Ensure that everyone participates equally
- Keep time for students. You may want to provide 5 minute warnings.
- Be present during presentations. Correct any glaring errors. Either when they say it if it’s super urgent, or wait until afterwards if it’s a minor thing. Use your judgement, but don’t let things you know are wrong be said as fact.
- Mentors should have a clear understanding of the learning outcomes. You may want to ask clarifying questions.
- You're not expected to know the answers to all questions! You may even learn a lot yourself.

## Stop Go Continue
- Both mentors should be present
- Make sure [the Prime Directive](../retrospectives.md#prime-directive) is visible e.g. written on a whiteboard (particularly in earlier weeks)
- You may want to make the week schedule visible, to remind them of everything they have done.
- If students struggle to think of what to write, remind them that this feedback is used by:
  - mentors of the next week, to improve this cohort's experience
  - themselves, when they become mentors to the next cohort
- One mentor is responsible for taking notes & submitting a PR to `<city>-programme`
