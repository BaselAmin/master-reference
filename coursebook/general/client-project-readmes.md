# Guide to writing a good project `README.md`

It's really important to leave your project repo with a good `README.md`, and it'll make your life easier if you update it as you go along. Think of it as the front page of your project, where developers, employers and anyone else who's interested in your code can quickly understand what it does and how it works.

### Contents of the README (links to the different sections)
  - For example, [like this](#to-do)!
### Context of the project
  - Introduce the organisation and the problem they're seeking to solve.
### The app
  - How it addresses the problem.
  - User flow, user journey, and how the app is meant to work.
  - Prototyping process and Figma screenshots if you want!
### Tech stack
  - This could include interesting libraries you've used.
### Database schema/data model
  - This may be a database schema, or just an Airtable table setup.
### How to install and run in a development environment
  - Also, how to run tests.
### Platform
  - Summary of the platform you've used (for example, Airtable).
  - Maintenance 
### Deployment
  - How it's currently deployed.
  - Deployment instructions - which environment variables are needed? 
### To do
  - Any stretch goals or ideas for the next sprint.
### Contributing
  - If you're accepting contributions, how to do so.
### MIT license
  -  Remember to include a `LICENSE` file containing the MIT licence copy in your root
