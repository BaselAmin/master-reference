- Build a calculator that adds, substracts, divides, multiplies and shows the result of the equation.

#### Instructions:
- Use HTML, CSS and Javascript to develop the calculator.
- Split the features of the calculator to different github branches and make a pull request for each one.
- Style the calculator so it looks like an actual calculator :sweat_smile:
- Deploy the website with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Have fun!

#### Stretch goals:
- Button to clear the input.
- Button to clear the last number or symbol that was inputed.
- Deal with float inputs and not just integers.
- Add more mathematical operation
- Add easter eggs?

> Make sure to use the proper github flow, even though you are working by yourself.
