# Introduction to the Document Object Model

1. Start by going through all the information and exercises (just the first exercise) in the [following link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation), you can work on this individually because it contains a lot of reading.

2. Find a student that you can pair up with and go through lessons 1-5 [here](https://dom-tutorials.appspot.com/static/1.html).

    *NOTE: the last exercise - the tree walker is not mandatory and is a bonus if you've finished early*
