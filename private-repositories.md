# A guide to Founders and Coders GitHub repositories
_Updated February 2019_

## Public repositories

Since its inception, Founders and Coders has embraced the open-source model for developing curriculum and learning resources. For this reason, most repositories in the Founders and Coders GitHub organisation are _public._ 

## Private repositories

Founders and Coders also uses GitHub to coordinate the business of our CIC. Frequently, coordination of this nature involves raising issues where it is necessary to share personal information about students and clients. Given the regions in which we operate international programmes (Israel and Gaza), we also find ourselves in a position where participant privacy is directly related to participant safety. For these reasons, some of our repositories are private.

## Accessing private repositories

When someone joins a Founders and Coders course, they are invited to join the Founders and Coders GitHub organisation. All current and past course participants have access to private repositories, unless they have left the GitHub organisation. 

A small number of people are members of the CIC who have not taken the course, and they are also members of the GitHub organisation.
