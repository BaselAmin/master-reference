    - [README.md](https://github.com/FAC10/research/blob/master/README.md)
    - [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/FAC10/research/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - [ ] Add new and previous cohort as owners to this FAC-X Github organisation

## Curriculum

- [ ] Ensure the previous cohort has followed the [curriculum update process](curriculum-update-process.md) and that any issues or PRs are raised well in advance of the relevant week start.
- [ ] Escalate open PRs or issues to the MRMs or @sofer directly if they need attention
- [ ] Open an issue to recruit alumni speakers ([example](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/london-programme/issues/806)), and make sure the first 4 weeks are confirmed before course start
